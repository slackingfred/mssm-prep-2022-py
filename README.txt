Chang Qian's MSSM Summer Preparation, Python Assignment
=======

I have some work experience with Python, but that was several years ago and the
version involved was 2.7. I have only used Python (3.6+) casually ever since.
However, I am no novice to imperative programming; the two major languages I've
mastered are C and Go. Hence, I did not go through the Python 101 for this
assignment; instead, I consulted Python docs (https://docs.python.org/3/) and
tried to recollect the distant memories of scripting languages. The result is
a working implementation in less than 8 hours, but it may not be very graceful
in light of the Zen of Python.

I think the tasks 1 & 2 in the description can be summarized as cleaning up or
normalizing the input data; thus, I put them in a separate script named
`datacleanup.py`. To derive the final output, `main.py` is run against the
normalized 'intermediate data', whose path should be specified in `conf.py`.

Happy summer holiday! I'm moving on to the next, more challenging assignment of
Data Structures & Algorithms.
